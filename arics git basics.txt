create a working copy of a local repository by running the command
git clone /path/to/repository
when using a remote server, your command will be
git clone username@host:/path/to/repository

add & commit
You can propose changes (add it to the Index) using
git add <filename>
git add *
This is the first step in the basic git workflow. To actually commit these changes use
git commit -m "Commit message"
Now the file is committed to the HEAD, but not in your remote repository yet.

pushing changes
Your changes are now in the HEAD of your local working copy. To send those changes to your remote repository, execute 
git push origin master
Change master to whatever branch you want to push your changes to. 

If you have not cloned an existing repository and want to connect your repository to a remote server, you need to add it with
git remote add origin <server>
Now you are able to push your changes to the selected remote server

update & merge
to update your local repository to the newest commit, execute 
git pull
